&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health &amp;amp; Well-being&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical &amp;amp; Financial Capital, and Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inclusive Development for Aspirational India&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinvigorating Human Capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Innovation and R&amp;amp;D&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimum Government and Maximum Governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions made by &lt;strong&gt;The Finance Commission&lt;/strong&gt; in its report tabled in the parliament in Feb were also accepted with a few exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;India’s first finance commission was constitued in 1951 under the leadership of &lt;strong&gt;K. C. Niyogi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before that, an interim finance comission was appointed under &lt;strong&gt;C. D. Deshmukh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 15th Finance Commission was constituted in 2017, under the chairmanship of &lt;strong&gt;N K Singh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://constitutionofindia.etal.in/article_280/&quot;&gt;Article 280&lt;/a&gt; of the Constitution spells out the formation, structure and functions of the Finance Commission. The transfers to states etc are made under &lt;strong&gt;Articles 270, 275 and 280&lt;/strong&gt; which provide mechanisms for &lt;strong&gt;vertical&lt;/strong&gt; sharing between Centre and states, and &lt;strong&gt;horizontal&lt;/strong&gt; sharing among states.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="economy" /><summary type="html">The government laid this year’s budget on six plillars of economy, namely:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Test Angel</title><link href="/reading/2021/04/15/test-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Test Angel" /><published>2021-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/reading/2021/04/15/test-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="/reading/2021/04/15/test-post.html">&lt;p&gt;The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a rare book both in its choice of protagonist and language. It is unifromly poetic with a rustic prairie charm peppered in. The range and depth of emotion can hardly be found in another novel. One can say, even Joyce and Woolf pale in front of this insightful treatment of old age and womanhood. So far, I have not been able to pick up reading pace because reading this book is like a slow walk through strange
Canadian woods and one has to stop and admire the tendrillous manifestations of lingusitic shoots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most touching moment in the first quarter of the book is when Hagar denies her brother’s request to don their mother’s shawl to comfort their dying brother. She has not seen her mother, she died birthing her, and cannot bring herself to put on the pretence of being her even though she loves her brother.&lt;/p&gt;
